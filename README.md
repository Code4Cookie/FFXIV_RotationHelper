If you have "Could not load type 'Newtonsoft.Json'" error, download Newtonsoft.Json.dll and place it into the folder that includes ACT.exe.


### TODO ::

1. ~~Remove AssemblyResolver. (Embed .dll in .exe)~~

2. Update ActionTable.csv for patch 5.x. (have to support both 4.x and 5.x for a while)

3. ~~Remove RotationWindow from Alt+Tab menu.~~

4. Add feature to save ffxivrotations URL with memo.

5. Update pet data when pet has left the battlefield.
